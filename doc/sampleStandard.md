## Sample standard

> Copy And Run

For most of projects, samples are needed. By providing samples, users can easily run examples which depend on your projects.

The problem is a lot of projects provide awkward samples which can not be ran or can not be understand easily. I think if we bring up a simple sample standard, we can help with each other to avoid this situation.

### Basic elements for a sample

- A name used to describe what it is.

- How to view or download sample

- How to set up environment.

- Where is the sample entrance.

- How to run sample.

- Check sample result.
